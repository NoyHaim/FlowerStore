    <p> Hi, My name is Noy Haim.</p>
    <p> I am selling flowers.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The additional pages I created:</p>
    <p> 1. Wishlist - users can add add items to a "wish list" which are items you want but not yet want to buy. <br>
        - Go to /private/wishlist.html
    </p>
    <p> 2. Purchases - users can see their previous orders. <br>
        - Go to /private/purchases.html
    </p>
    <p> 3. Home page. <br>
        - Go to /private/home.html
    </p>
    <p> What was hard for me? <br>
        Getting use to work with redis and the design of the pages.
    </p>
    <p> I did the project alone.</p>
    <p>
        Supported routes:<br>
        - /login<br>
        - /register<br>
        - /private/home<br>
        - /private/store<br>
        - /private/add-to-cart<br>
        - /private/remove-from-cart<br>
        - /private/add-to-wishlist<br>
        - /private/remove-from-wishlist<br>
        - /private/cart<br>
        - /private/wishlist<br>
        - /private/purchases<br>
        - /private/checkout<br>
        - /private/admin (for admin only)<br>
        - /private/logout<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I made my store secured by adding try/catch to the routs<br>
        which helps me recognize unauthorized accesses to the website routs.<br>
        I also verified for every user who asks for access to a private route,<br>
        using cookies and an "active users" dictionary which stores the users that preformed a valid login.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I did not use react.
